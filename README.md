# Serverless Web Application and AWS Infrastructure Optimization

## Overview  
This project showcases the development of a **serverless web application** using AWS services, focusing on scalability, cost-efficiency, and security. The application leverages key AWS tools and services such as Lambda, API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB, EC2, IAM, and CloudWatch. The infrastructure is designed to deliver an optimized solution for modern web application requirements.  

---

## Features  
- **Serverless Architecture**: Built using AWS Lambda for compute, API Gateway for API management, and DynamoDB for database functionality.  
- **Secure and Optimized Infrastructure**: Used IAM for access control and EC2 for supplementary compute resources.  
- **Efficient Monitoring**: Integrated AWS CloudWatch to track application performance and identify areas for improvement.  
- **Scalability and Cost-Effectiveness**: Leveraged S3 for hosting static assets, ensuring reliability and reduced operational costs.

## Technologies Used  
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute service for backend logic.  
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Managed API service for building and deploying RESTful APIs.  
- **Amazon S3**: Secure, durable, and scalable storage for hosting static assets.  
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database service for high-performance data storage.  
- **Amazon EC2**: Compute service for supporting infrastructure optimization.  
- **AWS IAM**: Identity and Access Management for secure resource access.  
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitoring and observability service for application performance tracking.

## Key Highlights  
1. **Serverless Implementation**: Eliminated the need for traditional server management with AWS Lambda and API Gateway.  
2. **Data Management**: Stored and retrieved application data using Amazon DynamoDB for real-time access.  
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitored application health and set up alerts using AWS CloudWatch.  
4. **Security Optimization**: Implemented fine-grained access controls with AWS IAM roles and policies.  
5. **Scalability**: Ensured horizontal scaling with serverless architecture and S3-hosted assets.
